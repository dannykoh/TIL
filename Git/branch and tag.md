# Branches vs Tags

In nutshell, branches are used for active development, are mutable, and represent different lines of work, while tags are used for marking important points in the Git history, are immutable, and represent specific snapshots or releases. Understanding when and how to use branches and tags is crucial for effective Git workflow management.

Details are as follow.

**1. Purpose**

- **Branches** <br>Branches are used for ongoing development work. They represent different lines of development and are typically used for features, bug fixes, or experiments. Branches are mutable, and you can add new commits to them.

- **Tags** <br>Tags are used for marking specific points in the Git history, such as releases or significant milestones. Tags are immutable and are used to create a snapshot of a specific commit at a given point in time.

**2. Mutability**

- **Branches** <br>Branches are mutable, meaning you can add new commits to them by making new commits on the branch or by merging other branches into them.

- **Tags** <br>Tags are immutable. Once you create a tag, it points to a specific commit, and you cannot move it to a different commit without creating a new tag.

**3. Naming**

- **Branches** <br>Branch names are typically more descriptive and can change over time as development progresses. Branch names often reflect the purpose of the branch, such as "feature/new-feature" or "bugfix/fix-issue-123."

- **Tags** <br>Tag names are usually more concise and represent a specific point in time, such as "v1.0" for a release.

**4. Usage**

- **Branches** <br>Branches are actively used during development to work on new code or bug fixes. Developers switch between branches to switch contexts and work on different tasks.

- **Tags** <br>Tags are used for marking stable points in the history, such as releases. They are typically used for creating version numbers or referencing historical states of the codebase.

**4. Lifecycle**

- **Branches** <br>Branches have a shorter lifecycle and can be created and deleted frequently during development.

- **Tags** <br>Tags have a longer and more persistent lifecycle. They are usually created for specific, well-defined points in the project's history and are not typically deleted.

**4. Merging**

- **Branches** <br>Branches are often merged into other branches (e.g., feature branches merged into the main branch) to incorporate changes into the main codebase.

- **Tags** <br>Tags are not merged; they point to a specific commit and remain fixed.
