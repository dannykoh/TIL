# Forking vs Cloning

Forking and cloning are both actions related to working with version control systems like Git, often used in the context of GitHub. However, they serve different purposes and involve different actions:

## Forking a Repository:

- **Definition:** Forking a repository creates a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account. It essentially duplicates the entire repository, including all of its files, commits, branches, and history.

- **Purpose:** Forking is commonly used when you want to contribute to an open-source project or collaborate on a project without directly modifying the original repository. It allows you to work on your own copy of the project while keeping the original repository unchanged.

- **Workflow:** After forking, you can make changes to your forked repository, create new branches, make commits, and push changes. When you're ready, you can submit a pull request to the original repository's owner to propose your changes be merged into the original repository.
## Cloning a Repository:

- **Definition:** Cloning a repository involves creating a copy of the repository on your local machine. This copy includes all the files, commits, branches, and history.

- **Purpose:** Cloning is used when you want to start working with a repository locally, either to contribute to it, make changes, or simply have a local copy of the project to work with.

- **Workflow:** Once you've cloned a repository, you can work on it locally, create new branches, make commits, and push changes back to the remote repository when you're ready. Cloning is often the first step in contributing to a project after forking.

## Summary

Forking is primarily about creating an independent copy of a repository in your GitHub account, often for collaborative contributions, while cloning is about creating a local copy of a repository on your machine to work with.
